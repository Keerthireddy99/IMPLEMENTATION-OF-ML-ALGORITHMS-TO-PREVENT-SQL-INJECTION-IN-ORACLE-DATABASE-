### I.	INTRODUCTION

In the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity, SQL injection attacks pose a significant threat to database integrity [1]. These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in software that allow malicious hacker to inject hamrful SQL code into queries, enabling them to manipulate data, execute unauthorized commands, and potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information [3]. To address this growing concern, my study leverages the power of Machine Learning (ML) to detect and prevent SQL injection, enhancing the overall security framework.

ML techniques have emerged as a promising approach for detecting SQL injection attacks due to their ability to learn from patterns in data and identify anomalies [2], [3]. In this paper, I outline a comprehensive methodology for detecting SQL injection using ML, encompassing data collection, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. I compare various ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forests, to determine the most effective model for SQL injection detection. Additionally, I explore the use of deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to further enhance detection accuracy.

Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of ML-based approaches for SQL injection detection, achieving high accuracy and precision in identifying malicious queries as stated by [4]. I highlight key factors that contribute to the success of my proposed methodology, including the use of appropriate data preprocessing techniques, the selection of relevant features, and the careful tuning of ML hyperparameters. Furthermore, my comparison of different ML algorithms reveals that Logistic Regression consistently outperforms other models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

The contributions of my work are twofold: first, I present a comprehensive methodology for SQL injection detection using ML, providing a detailed framework that can be readily implemented by security practitioners. Second, I provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of ML-based approaches, showcasing their ability to accurately detect SQL injection attacks in real-world scenarios. my findings pave the way for the adoption of ML as a cornerstone of cybersecurity strategies, enabling organizations to proactively protect their valuable data assets from SQL injection threats.

My dataset on cybersecurity_attacks, curated from Kaggle, encompasses a diverse collection of both legitimate and malicious SQL queries. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating ML algorithms. Legitimate queries include common operations such as INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, while malicious patterns span classic SQL injection, union-based attacks, time-based blind injection, out-of-band attacks, and command execution. The dataset provides a real-world representation of potential threats encountered in various database environments.

### Key Variables

1. Timestamp (Date): Indicates when the queries were executed, enabling time-based analysis and trend identification.

2. Source and Destination IP Addresses: Unique identifiers for devices involved, facilitating per-device analysis.

3. Port Information: Source and destination port details, offering insights into network interactions.

4. Protocol: Specifies the communication protocol used (e.g., TCP), aiding in identifying communication patterns.

5. Packet Length: Indicates the size of data packets, relevant for understanding the nature of queries.

6. Packet Type: Categorizes packets as requests or responses, providing context to the query's purpose.

7. Traffic Type: Classifies queries into categories such as 'Database' or 'Other,' aiding in query categorization.

8. Payload Data: Contains the actual SQL queries, forming the crux of the dataset for ML analysis.

These variables collectively contribute to the dataset's richness and provide a holistic view of SQL query characteristics.

### II.	DATASET CONTRIBUTION TO PREDICTION

The dataset plays a pivotal role in training ML models to distinguish between legitimate and malicious queries. Through meticulous analysis of query patterns, the dataset enables the identification of features crucial for effective model training. The interplay of variables such as timestamp, IP addresses, and payload data allows for the creation of predictive models that can anticipate potential threats.
